  <h1>Burger decree!</h1>
  <h2>With permission from the king!</h2>

  <p class="intro">Please be aware that education is condemend! Books other than the ability to read basic law postings are forbidden!
    Please be sure to report free thinkers, as they will kidnap your children and drink their blood.
    If you see any teachers please notify the town watch immediately, It means demons are already in your area.
    We will do what we must to protect, and so should you.
  </p>

  <p>Also just a freindly reminder, please avoid making eyecontact with noble women as it is an afront to god, and the 
    punishment for such is the iron mask for the first offense, and de eyeing for the second. Should one by way of magic or act of demons,
    happen to grow their eyes back and repeat the offense a third time, they will be improsend in a steel crate 5 feet below ground.

    It has come to the attention that people are complaining about low food. the local scholar has come up with a solution,
    effictive now all villagers are to mix 30 percent wood meal into their food. let be known that dirt is not a good food replacement.
    and cannibalism is illegal unless the harvest celebration is upon us.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A final note, Peasents of maywood you have been demoted to serf! Please report monday for the wonderous
    world of agriculture.
